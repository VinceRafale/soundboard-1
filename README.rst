============
 Soundboard
============

This is a simple soundboard app for Android.

Basically, place any MP3, FLAC, or other Android-supported audio files
into the "Soundboard" directory of your device's primary storage area
(i.e. next to "Music", "Downloads", etc.).  You can either create this
directory yourself or run the app once after which the folder will be
auto-created.

After loading your Soundboard directory, run the app.  Your sound
files should now be at your fingertips to play in soundboard fashion.

This is an initial, primitive release, but it does work at a basic
level.  Feel free to fork this app.  :)

For those who want to simply run this without building it themselves,
I've uploaded an APK to my personal web site:
